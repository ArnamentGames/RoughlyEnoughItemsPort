# RoughlyEnoughItems
A project to make (AEI) [https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/almost-enough-items] to look like JEI

**Only supports 1.13.2 for now**

### Features added from JEI
- Better Searching
  - Accepts Searching by Tooltip (Prefix: #)
  - Accepts Excluding (Prefix: -)
  - Accepts Multiple Searching (Use: |)
  - Example: `-@randommod stone` will search items not from randommod named stone
- Fixed Creative Gui
- Added Useless Tabs lol _(I will make them useful in the future)_
- All Enchanting Books
- Potion Recipe (Experimental)
- Fixed Scrolling (by a bit)
- One page now shows 2 recipe

### Features that I will work on in the future
- Hide Gui with Control / Command + O

I know this is still buggy and basic but I am trying to make this better :)
